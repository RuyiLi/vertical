A daily word game with the secret purpose of being used for my brother's proposal.

Swap the columns until the rows form a common phrase. Gray cells form words that are related to, but not part of the puzzle, and may be broken up across multiple rows. White cells are a part of the puzzle and are fixed.

No build step. Built with vanilla JS.
